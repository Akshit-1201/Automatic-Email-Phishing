You are a **cybersecurity engineer** building an **educational phishing-simulation playground for college students**.
This system is **strictly for learning purposes** and must not enable real-world phishing or harm.

### Build an application that follows this workflow:

1. Send an **initial legitimate-looking email**

   * No links
   * No credential requests
   * Encourages the user to reply for more information

2. **Wait for user response**

   * If the user replies:

     * Analyze the reply using an LLM
     * Classify intent as:

       * *Worried / Curious*
       * *Unbothered / Dismissive*
     * Send a follow-up email in the same thread:

       * Gradual escalation for *Worried / Curious*
       * Attention-grabbing message for *Unbothered / Dismissive*

   * If the user does not reply:

     * Send a reminder email
     * Retry up to **3 times**
     * Stop interaction after 3 failed attempts

3. Maintain:

   * Email thread continuity
   * Retry count
   * Intent state
   * Full logging for learning analysis

### Requirements:

* Use an LLM **only for intent classification**
* Limit follow-ups to a maximum of 3


Build this as a **clear, modular, and student-friendly educational system**.
